# Full Stack ND P2: Tournament Results

This is the 2nd project of the FullStack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

The goal for this project was to develop a database schema to store the game matches between players, and then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

## Content

- `tournament.py`: Tournament required functions.
- `tournament.sql`: SQL file to create required database, tables and views.
- `tournament_test.py`: This is the main file to test the `tournament.py` functions.

## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/marionuevo/fsnd-p2-tournamentResults/archive/master.zip).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/marionuevo/fsnd-p2-tournamentResults.git`.

Then, run `\i tournament.sql` command from psql environment and run the program with `python tournament_test.py` from the command line.
