# Full Stack ND P2: Tournament Results

This is the 2nd project of the FullStack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

The goal for this project was to develop a database schema to store the game matches between players, and then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

In order to use the program you should:
- clone the git repository
- use `tournament.sql`to create the database using `\i tournament.sql` command from psql environment
- run the program typewriting `python tournament_test.py` from the command line and evaluate
